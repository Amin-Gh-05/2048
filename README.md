# 2048 Game in Terminal
It's a simple **2048** game in *terminal*

## User Interface
Let's have a look at the main menu:
1: New Game
2: Leaderboard
3: Exit
> All you've gotta do is to choose a number and either enter a <sub>new game</sub>, review <sub>leaderboard</sub> or <sub>exit</sub> the game

## Game Functionality
In case you don't know the rules, visit [2048 official page](https://play2048.co/)
> [!TIP]
> In order to move, user keys <kbd>UP</kbd>, <kbd>DOWN</kbd>, <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> or <kbd>LEFT</kbd>

## Contribution
I'll sincerely be thankful to anyone looking forward to make this game more user-friendly
If you're looking forward to doing so, you can work on these issues:
- `void showMenu()` function
- `void pullLeaderBoard(int lc)` function
- Style of the main board
